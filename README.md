# ProjectSpyn

ProjectSpyn is a robotics control system implemented in MATLAB for interacting with LEGO Mindstorms EV3. Project Spyn is a inclusivity project designed to improve mobility for speacially-abled people by providing personalized autonomous transportation over the city (maze).

## Features

- **Keyboard Control**: Use standard keys to move the robot forward, backward, and to turn left or right on pickup and drop-off zones.
- **Autonomous Navigation**: Automatically navigates a maze designed to mimick a road system for a city.
- **Lift Mechanism**: Control the robot's lift arm for raising and lowering objects.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Displays actions on the MATLAB console for better user interaction.

## Requirements

- MATLAB with LEGO Mindstorms EV3 Support Package
- LEGO Mindstorms EV3 Brick
- EV3 motors connected to specific ports:
  - Driving motors: Ports `A` and `D`
  - Lift motor: Port `B`
- EV3 sensors connected to the following ports:
  - Color sensor: 3
  - UltraSonic sensor: 2
  - Touch sensor: 1

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RETR0-OS/ProjectSpyn.git
   ```
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the project directory.
3. Ensure the EV3 brick is powered on and connected via Bluetooth or USB.

## Usage

1. Set the pickup and dropoff locations in ProjectSpyn.m.
2. Run `ProjetSpyn.m` in MATLAB.
3. The robot navigates the maze autonomously to go to the pickup location and dropoff locations (Blue, Green, or Yellow).
4. At the pickup and dropoff locations, use the following keys for control:
   - `w`: Move forward
   - `s`: Move backward
   - `a`: Turn left
   - `d`: Turn right
   - `g`: Lower the lift
   - `t`: Raise the lift
   - `q`: Quit the keyboard control mode
